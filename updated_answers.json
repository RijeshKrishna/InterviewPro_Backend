        "question": "What is a Linear Data Structure? Name a few examples.",
        "answer": "A data structure is linear if all its elements or data items are arranged in a sequence or a linear order. The elements are stored in a non-hierarchical way so that each item has successors and predecessors except the first and last element in the list. Examples of linear data structures are Arrays, Stack, Strings, Queue, and Linked List."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between file structure and storage structure?",

    {
        "question": "You are trying to provide a service in a particular region, but you do not see the service in that region. Why is this happening, and how do you fix it?",
        "answer": "Not all Amazon AWS services are available in all regions. When Amazon initially launches a new service, it doesn’t get immediately published in all the regions. They start small and then slowly expand to other regions. So, if you don’t see a specific service in your region, chances are the service hasn’t been published in your region yet. However, if you want to get the service that is not available, you can switch to the nearest region that provides the services."
